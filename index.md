## [Project 1 : Housing Prices Calculator](https://lipsum.com/)
- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
- Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
- It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
- It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## [Project 2: Cancer Detection](https://lipsum.com/)
- It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
- The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
- Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
- Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
